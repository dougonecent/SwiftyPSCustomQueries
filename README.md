# SwiftyPSCustomQueries

_SwiftyPSCustomQueries_ is a companion library used alongside [SwiftyPSCore](https://github.com/dougpenny/SwiftyPSCore). The purpose of this library is to provide examples for accessing custom [PowerQueries](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/powerqueries) in PowerSchool. While these specific queries may not be useful for your particular case, hopefully they can be used as a template to help you create your own PowerQueries. For more detailed usage information, please see the [SwiftyPSCore](https://github.com/dougpenny/SwiftyPSCore) repository.

PowerQueries allow you write custom SQL statements to fetch data from PowerSchool; they are created using the PowerSchool plugin interface. The PowerQueries for this package are defined in the example plugin, [PSCustomQueriesPlugin](https://github.com/dougpenny/PSCustomQueriesPlugin). You can learn more about PowerQueries on the [PowerSchool Developer Support](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/powerqueries) site.

_SwiftyPSCustomQueries is not endorsed, sponsored, or affilitated with PowerSchool in any way._
